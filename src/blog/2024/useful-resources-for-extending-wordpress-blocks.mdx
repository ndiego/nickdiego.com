I recently had the opportunity to present at [WordCamp US](https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/session/the-power-of-extending-the-wordpress-editor-a-block-visibility-showcase/), where I talked about my [Block Visibility](https://blockvisibilitywp.com/) plugin and the power of extending the WordPress Editor. Some of you might even be reading this while I'm still on stage.

Below is a list of resources to help you build your own Editor extensions, along with links related to the Block Visibility plugin.

For transparency, I’ve created or contributed to most of these resources. If you have any additional recommendations that are not included here, please share them in the comments.
