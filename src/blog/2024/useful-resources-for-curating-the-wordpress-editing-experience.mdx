During [my recent talk](https://canada.wordcamp.org/2024/session/your-wordpress-your-way-curating-the-editor-experience/) at WordCamp Canada (#WCEH), I mentioned several resources that help you curate the editing experience in WordPress. Here's a list of my go-to tools, articles, and videos on the subject.

For transparency, I created or contributed to most of these resources. So, if you have any additional recommendations or curation techniques not covered here, please share them in the comments. The more examples, the better.

## Tools

- [Editor Curation Examples](https://github.com/ndiego/editor-curation-examples): A plugin that showcases various Editor curation methods. It includes each demo presented at WordCamp Canada.
- [Nautilus](https://github.com/ndiego/nautilus): The experimental block theme that powers this site and the WordCamp Canada presentation. It includes several [Editor modifications](https://github.com/ndiego/nautilus/blob/main/assets/js/modify-block-supports.js).
