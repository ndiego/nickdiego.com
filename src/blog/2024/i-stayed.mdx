For those wondering, [I stayed](https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment/). It wasn't a question.

A year and a half ago, I joined Automattic with one clear purpose: to dedicate myself full-time to WordPress and collaborate with an incredible team of open-source contributors.

I truly love what I do. Whether it's participating on WordPress [release squads](https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-7/), writing Gutenberg [pull requests](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Andiego), educating the community through [Developer Hours](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1pJFUVKQ7ETApyQQlt3pLNjPx2HrQwl5), writing for the [Developer Blog](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/), working on the [WordPress.org redesign](https://make.wordpress.org/meta/tag/website-redesign/), or building [demo plugins and themes](https://github.com/ndiego?tab=repositories) that highlight new functionality—every aspect excites me.

I could go on, but simply put: I love my work and the people I work alongside at Automattic and within the broader community.

Automattic stands alone in the WordPress space. No other company invests so heavily in open-source and provides its employees with this level of freedom to pursue what they believe in.

This week has been tough, and I’ll deeply miss those who are moving on to new opportunities. I wish them nothing but success.

Today is a time for reflection and planning. But come Monday, I'll be back at it—working to make WordPress the best it can be.
