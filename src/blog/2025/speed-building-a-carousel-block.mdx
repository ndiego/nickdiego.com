Yesterday, I competed against Jessica Lyschik in the [Speed Build Challenge](https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/session/wordpress-speed-build-challenge/) at WordCamp Asia, which was hosted by Jamie Marsland. I was handily defeated. If you want to witness my failure, [check out the live stream recording](https://www.youtube.com/live/2yrL786f4rc?feature=shared&t=15736).

Jessica and I were tasked with rebuilding the homepage of [diablaoutdoor.com](http://diablaoutdoor.com) in WordPress. While Jessica took a practical approach, I decided to experiment with AI to recreate the carousel element in the site's header.

During the 30-minute challenge, I used Cursor to build a rough prototype. The idea was to use Cover blocks for the slides and then create a wrapper block that would handle the carousel functionality. By the end, I had a working, if imperfect, version of the carousel.

After the competition, I spent another hour refining it. For a total of 1.5 hours of prompting, I am quite happy with the result.

You can [check out the plugin](https://github.com/ndiego/carousel-block-speed-build) on GitHub.

It's interesting to browse through the files and see how the AI built the plugin. The block not quite production-ready, but it's close. I would want to add more controls for modifying the carousel, such as autoplay, speed adjustments, and better mobile responsiveness.

So while I lost the competition, it was a fun challenge to see how quickly you can leverage AI to build complicated functionality. Congrats again to Jessica on another well-deserved victory.
