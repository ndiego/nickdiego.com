Two of my WordPress plugins have reached 30,000 active users. Block Visibility hit this milestone at the end of November 2024, and just last week, the Icon Block followed suit. Seeing these numbers grow is both exciting and humbling.

Building a successful product takes effort and a fair amount of luck. While 30,000 users isn't on the scale of plugins like Jetpack or Yoast, it's incredible to know so many people rely on these tools everyday.

As I write this on a flight to [WordCamp Asia 2025](https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/) in Manila, I'm reflecting on how these two small plugins have shaped my career. I started creating WordPress plugins in 2012. After the pandemic, I went full-time, with Block Visibility as my first major project. Seeing it—and now the Icon Block—reach this milestone is deeply meaningful.

At [WordCamp US 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j84uRtUfDUM&t=4135s), I shared how much this journey has impacted me. Both plugins are now Community Plugins, meaning they will never be monetized. They're built for the WordPress community, and anyone can contribute via their respective GitHub repositories. The Icon Block, in particular, has recently sparked great discussions about new features. Pull requests are always welcome.

The future of WordPress plugin development is both exciting and uncertain. AI is changing how we build software. While the next steps are unclear, I'm looking forward to seeing how innovation shapes our WordPress ecosystem. No matter what happens, I'll keep building open-source tools that empower WordPress users and developers.

Thank you to everyone who has used and supported my projects. I hope to see some of you at WordCamp Asia this week.
